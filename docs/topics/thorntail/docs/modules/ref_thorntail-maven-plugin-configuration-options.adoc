= {Thorntail} Maven plugin configuration options

The {Thorntail} Maven plugin accepts the following configuration options:

bundleDependencies::
If true, dependencies are included in the `-thorntail.jar` file.
Otherwise, they are resolved from `$M2_REPO` or from the network at runtime.
+
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
|Property
|`thorntail.bundleDependencies`

|Default
|true

|Used by
|`package`
|===

debug::
The port to use for debugging.
If set, the Thorntail process suspends on start and opens a debugger on this port.
+
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
|Property
|`thorntail.debug.port`

|Default
|

|Used by
|`run`, `start`
|===

environment::
A properties-style list of environment variables to use when executing the application.
+
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
|Property
|_none_

|Default
|

|Used by
|`multistart`, `run`, `start`
|===

environmentFile::
A `.properties` file with environment variables to use when executing the application.
+
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
|Property
|`thorntail.environmentFile`

|Default
|

|Used by
|`multistart`, `run`, `start`
|===

filterWebInfLib::
If true, the plugin removes artifacts that are provided by the Thorntail runtime from the `WEB-INF/lib` directory of the project WAR file.
Otherwise, the contents of `WEB-INF/lib` remain untouched.
+
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
|Property
|`thorntail.filterWebInfLib`

|Default
|true

|Used by
|`package`
|===

[NOTE]
--
This option is generally not necessary and is provided as a workaround in case the Thorntail plugin removes a dependency required by the application.
When false, it is the responsibility of the developer to ensure that the `WEB-INF/lib` directory does not contain Thorntail artifacts that would compromise the functionality of the application.
One way to do that is to avoid expressing dependencies on fractions and rely on xref:auto-detecting-fractions_{context}[auto-detection] or by explicitly listing any required extra fractions using the *fractions* option.
--

fractionDetectMode::
+
--
The mode of fraction detection. The available options are:

* `when_missing`: Runs only when no {Thorntail} dependencies are found.
* `force`: Always run, and merge any detected fractions with the existing dependencies. Existing dependencies take precedence.
* `never`: Disable fraction detection.

|===
|Property
|`thorntail.detect.mode`

|Default
|`when_missing`

|Used by
|`package`, `run`, `start`

--

fractions::
+
--
A list of extra fractions to include when using auto-detection. It is useful for fractions that cannot be detected or for user-provided fractions.

Use one of the following formats when specifying a fraction:
* `group:artifact:version`
* `artifact:version`
* `artifact`

If no group is provided, `io.thorntail` is assumed.

If no version is provided, the version is taken from the {Thorntail} BOM for the version of the plugin you are using.

If the value starts with a `!` character, the corresponding auto-detected fraction is not installed (unless it is a dependency of any other fraction).
In the following example the Undertow fraction is not installed even though your application references a class from the `javax.servlet` package:

useUberJar::
If specified, the `-thorntail.jar` file located in `${project.build.directory}` is used.

NOTE: Before version 2.3.0.Final, this property was called `wildfly-swarm.useUberJar`, and only setting it to `true` enabled this behavior: `-Dwildfly-swarm.useUberJar=true`.
You can continue using the old name in later releases, but consider using the new variant, which no longer requires you to set a value: `-Dthorntail.useUberJar`.
