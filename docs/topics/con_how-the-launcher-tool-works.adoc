= How the {launcher} tool works

The {launcher} tool runs on OpenShift and lets you create functional example applications called missions. The {launcher} tool walks you through:

* choosing the mission you want to generate,
* choosing the runtime you want to use, and
* choosing how you want to build and execute the mission.

The {launcher} tool uses your choices to generate a custom project, called a booster, and either launches it directly to the same OpenShift instance, or provides a downloadable ZIP version of the project.
