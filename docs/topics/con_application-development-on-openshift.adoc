= Application Development on OpenShift

Application Development on OpenShift is:

* A collection of runtimes, such as Thorntail and Spring Boot, designed to run on OpenShift.
* A prescriptive approach to cloud-native development on OpenShift.

The goal of Application Development on OpenShift is to provide prescriptive architectures, design patterns, tools, and best practices in ready-made example applications that you can execute on OpenShift to enable cloud-native development.

Cloud-native development is an approach to developing, deploying, and running applications that take full advantage of cloud computing.
