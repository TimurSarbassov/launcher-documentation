= What is {ProductName}

{ProductName} provides you with cloud-native runtimes and prescribes approaches to developing, building, and deploying applications that use those cloud-native runtimes on OpenShift.
These cloud-native development approaches take advantage of the capabilities provided by OpenShift and enable you to use patterns such as Circuit Breaker, Health Check, and Service Discovery.

Application Development on OpenShift is:

* A collection of runtimes, such as {Thorntail} and {SpringBoot}, designed to run on OpenShift.
* A prescriptive approach to cloud-native development on OpenShift.

The goal of {ProductName} is to provide prescriptive architectures, design patterns, tools, and best practices in ready-made example applications that you can execute on OpenShift to enable cloud-native development.

Cloud-native development is an approach to developing, deploying, and running applications that take full advantage of cloud computing.
