= {name-launcher} Launcher

{name-launcher} launcher is a project generator for jumpstarting cloud-native application development on OpenShift. It provides a way of creating functional example applications as well as an easy way to build and deploy these example applications on OpenShift.

Using {name-launcher} launcher, you can create and deploy an example application to OpenShift using the Build and Deploy to OpenShift build process, which is based on the Source-to-Image (S2I) build process. Build and Deploy to OpenShift configures OpenShift to pull the code of your example application from your GitHub repository, build the code, and deploy it to OpenShift.
